## What I learnt?

- Managing a Git repository allowed me to have hands-on experience with software version control. I learned how to use pull requests (PRs) to efficiently track changes and guarantee code quality before merging into the main branch. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of RESTful API integration for smooth service-to-service communication. Through this procedure, automated CI/CD pipelines were improved. Unit tests are triggered by successful builds, and containerized applications are then deployed to DockerHub, which streamlines deployment and scalability for real-world applications.
